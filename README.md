# Makers_BnB

The goals for this challenge from Week 5 of the Makers course was to learm how to code as part of an engineering team to build a clone of Airbnb.

My teammates for this week were [Tatiana Nantes](https://github.com/tatiananantes), [Monaliza Wohlers](https://github.com/monawoh) and [Sigita Zebrauskaite](https://github.com/sigii1992).

## Step One - MVP

MVP - Our MVP allows for a user to add properties and view available properties which a user can book. 

### MVP User Stories

```
As a user 
I want to see a list of available properties
So that I can I choose a place to stay

As a user
I want to add a property 
So that it can be booked

As a user 
I want to be able to see if a property is booked 
So that I can know if its available

```

### Step Two - Establishing User Functionality

```
As a user 
I want to be able to sign up to the site 
So that I am registered and can access it

As a user 
I want to be able to sign in to the site
So that I can list a property

```
- Our next steps if we had more time would have been to add in the ability for a user to book properties for specified dates. The step two user stories were completed the morning of our cohort project demo, so we opted to add some CSS styling to our page rather than implement the booking feature as we did not have time to get this fully functioning prior to our demo.
